**App Description:** My project is a weather app formatted using Bootstap. 
    On the homepage, we have a search bar where 
    you can search for a location anywhere in the world. When you start typing more
    than two characters, the top ten autocompleted options show up using awesomplete library.
    Below the search bar is the current weather for your location, if location services 
    are available. The "recent searches" module below that displays your last five
    most recent searches, which are stored in mongo. Each takes you to a weather page.
    A weather page can be accessed by searching for a location or by clicking on a 
    recent search. It shows you the current weather as well as a seven day forecast 
    for that location powered by open-meteo. You can click the blue button to go
    back to the homepage. Each user has a specific cookie id that tracks their session
    which is used to store and retrieve the recent searches in mongo.
